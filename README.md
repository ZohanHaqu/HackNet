HackNet (HackNet Is Not A Video Game)
HackNet is a software application that allows users to interact with the internet via a console interface. It provides various commands for accessing and managing internet-related information, such as displaying the user's IP address, WiFi details, and more. With features like file downloads, searches, and custom background colors, HackNet offers a simple yet powerful way to engage with the internet through a command-line interface.

Key Features:

Show IP: Displays the user's current public IP address.
WiFi: Displays details about the user's connected WiFi network.
Color Customization: Users can change the background color of the console.
Search: Allows users to search the web directly from the command line.
Download: Facilitates downloading files by interacting with the system's file manager. Unlike traditional methods like Invoke-WebRequest, the download command in HackNet uses Python's requests library to fetch the file and then uses the systemâ€™s file manager for saving it.
HackNet is not a game, but rather a tool for managing and displaying internet information in an interactive console environment.
